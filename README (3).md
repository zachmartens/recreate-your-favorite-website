# Recreate Your Favorite Website:
Using Bootstrap and JavaScript

Recreating a simplified version of a website you admire using Bootstrap. This project demonstrates Bootstrap layout and components and helps develop JavaScript skills for features to be implemented in the future.

## Table of Contents

- Navbar [#navbar]
- Home Page [#home]
- Form Section [#form]
- Table [#table]
- Bootstrap Components [#bootstrap]
- JavaScript [#javascript]

## Navbar

- Navbar includes at least 3 links (Home, About, Our Work, Connect)
- Uses Bootstrap for built-in responsiveness
- Implements BootStrap and CSS to make navbar bg-transparent, pulling the hero image up underneath to replicate original website
- Added Features: Logo for navbar-brand, a frosted element to pop the navbar text on top of hero images

## Home Page

- Homepage that matches the feel of original website
- Includes headings, images, and a hero section to introduce the site


## Form Section

- Single form for user input (#connect.html)
- Includes: First & Last Name, Email, Subject, Message
- Implements Boostrap validation for proper email input
- Added Feature: responsive css to highlight "send" button

## Table

- Table included to display relevent information
- Styled to match website elements

## 3 Bootstrap Components

- Three boostrap components suited for the website
- 1. Cards (as seen on #our-work.html, #from-on-high.html). Responsive to hover and highlight productions as well as devising cast memebers
- 2. Carousel (as seen on #good-bones.html, #from-on-high.html). Implemented to show production photos of these shows
- 3. Modal (for "Stay Connected" button in footer site-wide). Activating a pop-up to fill out and join the newsletter.


## JavaScript

- Validate Email: a simple way to ensure proper email structure. To be implemented in modal btn as well as Connect form
- Contact Storage:  Storing submissions from forms and modal to build out an ever-growing email list.
- Site Search Function: searching navigation to quickly find the location of a show and its information on the website
- Search Cast & Show Details: Searches the table data (on #test-kitchen.html), simulating a simple way to search for a show or a cast member and pull up similar information

## Challenges

- Sourcing and implementing new font styles not included in VSC
- Sourcing assets to replicate the original site
- Carousels! Images and thier finiky nature can be quite a hiccup in the process. I feel confident in getting to a place where they are workable, and look forward to learning more on how to manipulate and manage images for responsiveness and clarity


## Lessons Learned

This was a great and challenging project that really tested my knowlege and use of Bootstrap, as well as a great review of HTML/CSS. I do beleive I bit off quite a large project with the amount of images and styling that were on the site I chose to emulate. 

While it was a great challenge, I am proud of my ability to navigate challenges, research and deliver new skills, and feel confident in my gained knowlege. Hope you enjoy!
